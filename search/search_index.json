This makes it impossible to determine flight mode, or even if the craft is armed. Currently flightlog2kml tries to evince the armed state from other data. GPS Elevation. Unless you have a GPS attached to the TX, you don't get GPS altitude. This can be set by the -home-alt H value (in metres). Otherwise flightlog2kml will use an online elevation service. OpenTX creates a log per calendar day (IIRC), this means there may be multiple logs in the same file. Delimiting these individual logs is less than trivial, to some degree due to the prior CRSF issue which means arm / disarm is not reliably available. Currently, flightlog2kml assumes that a gap of more than 120 seconds indicates a new flight. The -split-time value allows a user-defined split time (seconds). Setting this to zero disables the log splitting function. fl2mqtt # The MQTT option (for BulletGCSS) uses a MQTT broker URI, which may include a username/password and cafile if required for authentication and/or encryption.

The mission will not exceed the inav maximum of 120 mission points (or configurated maximum). $ log2mission Usage of log2mission [options] file... -end-offset int End Offset (seconds) (default -30) -epsilon float Epsilon (default 0.015) -index int Log index -interval int Sampling Interval (ms) (default 1000) -max-wp int Maximum WPs in mission (default 120) -mode-filter string Mode filter (cruise,wp) -rebase string rebase all positions on lat,lon[,alt] -split-time int [OTX] Time(s) determining log split, 0 disables (default 120) -start-offset int Start Offset (seconds) (default 30) log2mission 0.12.3, commit: 43e033d The start-offset and end-offset compensate for the fact that the start / end of the flight is usually on the ground, and thus is not a good WP choice. The defaults are 30 seconds for the start offset and -30 seconds (i.e. 30 seconds from the end) for the end offset. The end offset may be specified as either a positive number of seconds from the start of the log or a negative number (from the end). Locations prior to the start offset and after the end offset are not considered for mission generation. If the end-offset is specified (0 cancels it), and there is no flight mode filter, then RTH is included in the generated mission. The mode-filter allows the log to filtered on Cruise and WP modes, e.g. -mode-filter=cruise , -mode-filter=wp , -mode-filter=cruise,wp . If mode-filter is specified, log entries not in the required flight mode(s) are discarded. Cruise includes both 2D and 3D cruise. epsilon tuning # The epsilon value is an opaque factor that controls the point simplification process (using the Ramer\u2013Douglas\u2013Peucker algorithm). The default value should be a good starting point for fixed wing with reasonably sedate flying. On a multi-rotor in a small flight area, a much smaller value (e.g. 0.001) would be more appropriate. Increasing the value will decrease the number of mission points generated. log2mission will do this automatically if the default value results in greater than max-wp mission points, for example: the log below would generate more than 70 points with the default epsilon value; too many if we are targeting inav 3.0.2 or earlier . $ log2mission -start-offset 60 -end-offset -120 -max-wp 60 /t/inav-contrib/otxlogs/demolog.TXT Flight : MrPlane on 2021-04-08 13:24:07 Firmware : INAV 3.0.0 (fc0e5e274) MATEKF405 of Apr 7 2021 / 17:02:08 Size : 19.36 MB Log : demolog.TXT / 1 Speed : 28.0 m/s at 13:54 Range : 17322 m at 14:22 Current : 30.6 A at 00:05 Distance : 48437 m Duration : 43:44 Altitude : 292.8 m at 25:42 Mission : 56 points (reprocess: 1, epsilon: 0.018) The output from this example would be demolog.1.mission multirotor example # With the default epsilon of 0.015, for a \"small field\" MR flight, it is often the case that no useful mission would be generated from a such \"short/complex\" flight, prior to the 0.98 release auto-correction, for example: $ log2mission logfs.TXT ... Mission : 2 points For 0.9.8, log2mission will make an attempt to resolve the \"short/complex\" 2 point results by increasing epsilon automatically. $ log2mission /t/inav-contrib/logfs.TXT Log : logfs.TXT / 1 ... Mission : 14 points (reprocess: 1, epsilon: 0.001000) Some experimentation may still be required to get a good mission, particularly for shorter MR flights. In particular, if reprocessing is indicated and the number of generated points is close to max-wp , then it's probably worth running again with a slightly larger epsilon than that shown in the output. Likewise, where log2mission has decreased the epsilon , it's probably worth running log2mission again with a slightly smaller epsilon than indicated. mission2kml # A standalone mission file to KML/Z converter is also provided. $ mission2kml --help Usage of mission2kml [options] mission_file -dms Show positions as DMS (vice decimal degrees) -home string Use home location The home location is given as decimal degrees latitude and longitude and optional altitude. The values should be separated by a single separator, one of \"/:; ,\". If space is used, then the values must be enclosed in quotes. In locales where comma is used as decimal \"point\", then comma should not be used as a separator. If a syntactically valid home position is given, without altitude, an online elevation service is used to adjust mission elevations in the KML. Examples: -home 54.353974/-4.5236 --home 48,9975:2,5789/104 -home 54.353974;-4.5236 --home \"48,9975 2,5789\" -home 54.353974,-4.5236,24 A KML file is generated to stdout, which may be redirected to a file, e.g: $ mission2kml -home 54.125229,-4.730443 barrule-h.mission > mtest.kml Note that for recent MW-XML mission files generated by mwp or the inav-configurator, the planned home located may be saved in the mission files; in which csae it will be used.

Limitations, Bugs, Bug Reporting # flightlog2kml aims to support as wide a range of inav firmware and log decoders as possible. During its development, inav has changed both the data logged and in some cases, the meaning of logged items; thus for versions of inav prior to 2.0, the reported flight mode might not be completely accurate. flightlog2kml is known to work with logs from 2015-10-30 (i.e. pre inav 1.0), and if you have a Blackbox log that is not decoded / visualised correctly, please raise a Github issue ; this is a bug. Due to the range of inav versions, blackbox_decode versions and supported operating systems, when reporting bugs, please include the following information in the Github issue: The version of flightlog2kml and blackbox_decode . Both applications have a --help option that should give the version numbers. The host operating system and version (e.g. \"Debian Sid\", \"Windows 10\", \"MacOS 10.15\"). Provide the blackbox log that illustrates the problem. If you don't want to post the log into an essentially public forum (the Github issue), then please propose a private delivery channel.

On Windows, as long as inav blackbox_decode can be found (which may mean on %PATH% or in the same directory as flightlog2kml (and the other tools), then dropping logs onto flightlog2kml is supported. Setting the Windows path # In order to have a simple setup on Windows / drag and drop for both blackbox_decode and flightlog2kml , one strategy might be to have the required applications in a single directory.

The defaults are 30 seconds for the start offset and -30 seconds (i.e. 30 seconds from the end) for the end offset. The end offset may be specified as either a positive number of seconds from the start of the log or a negative number (from the end). Locations prior to the start offset and after the end offset are not considered for mission generation. If the end-offset is specified (0 cancels it), and there is no flight mode filter, then RTH is included in the generated mission. The mode-filter allows the log to filtered on Cruise and WP modes, e.g. -mode-filter=cruise , -mode-filter=wp , -mode-filter=cruise,wp . If mode-filter is specified, log entries not in the required flight mode(s) are discarded. Cruise includes both 2D and 3D cruise.","title":"log2mission"},{"location":"#epsilon-tuning","text":"The epsilon value is an opaque factor that controls the point simplification process (using the Ramer\u2013Douglas\u2013Peucker algorithm). The default value should be a good starting point for fixed wing with reasonably sedate flying. On a multi-rotor in a small flight area, a much smaller value (e.g. 0.001) would be more appropriate. Increasing the value will decrease the number of mission points generated. log2mission will do this automatically if the default value results in greater than max-wp mission points, for example: the log below would generate more than 70 points with the default epsilon value; too many if we are targeting inav 3.0.2 or earlier . $ log2mission -start-offset 60 -end-offset -120 -max-wp 60 /t/inav-contrib/otxlogs/demolog.TXT Flight : MrPlane on 2021-04-08 13:24:07 Firmware : INAV 3.0.0 (fc0e5e274) MATEKF405 of Apr 7 2021 / 17:02:08 Size : 19.36 MB Log : demolog.TXT / 1 Speed : 28.0 m/s at 13:54 Range : 17322 m at 14:22 Current : 30.6 A at 00:05 Distance : 48437 m Duration : 43:44 Altitude : 292.8 m at 25:42 Mission : 56 points (reprocess: 1, epsilon: 0.018) The output from this example would be demolog.1.mission","title":"epsilon tuning"},{"location":"#multirotor-example","text":"With the default epsilon of 0.015, for a \"small field\" MR flight, it is often the case that no useful mission would be generated from a such \"short/complex\" flight, prior to the 0.98 release auto-correction, for example: $ log2mission logfs.TXT ... Mission : 2 points For 0.9.8, log2mission will make an attempt to resolve the \"short/complex\" 2 point results by increasing epsilon automatically. $ log2mission /t/inav-contrib/logfs.TXT Log : logfs.TXT / 1 ... Mission : 14 points (reprocess: 1, epsilon: 0.001000) Some experimentation may still be required to get a good mission, particularly for shorter MR flights. In particular, if reprocessing is indicated and the number of generated points is close to max-wp , then it's probably worth running again with a slightly larger epsilon than that shown in the output.
